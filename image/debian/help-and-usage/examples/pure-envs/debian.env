#>available-env< TZ Europe/Berlin
# The TZ variable in Docker images is an environment variable that sets the timezone of the container.
# You can use this to adjust the timezone of the container to match your host or your application.
# default: Europe/Berlin
#TZ=Europe/Berlin

#>available-env< MOS_RUN_MODE service
# The `MOS_RUN_MODE`, in contrast to the `TYPE` in the `--add-run-script`, does not affect the individual layer, but the behaviour in the whole image:
# -`action` will wait until all action-run-scripts are successful finished and then also stop the service-run-scripts
# -`service` starts all run-scripts and tries to restart services if they quit
# -`cascade` like `service` but also stops all other services as soon as a service ends
# -`external` like `service` but does not restart a ended service nor does it stop the others
# available: action|service|cascade|external
# default: service
#MOS_RUN_MODE=service
